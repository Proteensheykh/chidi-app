# Task ID: 7
# Title: Build AI-Powered Conversation Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core AI service that processes incoming messages, generates responses, and handles escalation logic for customer conversations.
# Details:
Create AI service with OpenAI integration for intent recognition, entity extraction, and response generation. Implement message processing Celery tasks that handle webhook ingestion, AI analysis, and response generation. Build context retrieval system that queries product catalog and business embeddings for relevant information. Create confidence scoring and escalation logic based on AI response quality and detected intents. Implement conversation state management and message persistence. Build prompt engineering system with templates for different conversation scenarios. Create AI response logging in ai_responses_log table for debugging and improvement. Implement automatic response sending via platform APIs with retry logic and error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for AI service methods, intent recognition, and entity extraction. Integration tests for complete message processing pipeline. Test confidence scoring and escalation triggers. Mock OpenAI API for consistent testing of AI logic and response generation.
