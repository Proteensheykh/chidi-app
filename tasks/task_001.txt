# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Infrastructure and Repository
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the monorepo structure with FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend, and configure core development infrastructure including Supabase, Prisma, and deployment pipeline.
# Details:
Create the complete file structure as specified in the PRD (backend/, frontend/, docs/, scripts/). Initialize FastAPI with main.py, configure Next.js 14 with App Router, setup Supabase project with PostgreSQL and Vector extensions. Configure Prisma for database management, setup environment variables (.env.example files), configure Docker for local development with docker-compose.yml including Redis for Celery. Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore, setup CI/CD pipeline basics, and configure deployment to Fly.io. Install core dependencies: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Prisma, Celery, Redis, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui components.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository structure matches PRD specifications, test local development environment startup (docker-compose up), confirm Supabase connection, validate Prisma schema generation, and ensure Next.js development server runs successfully.
