# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Workspace Onboarding System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop AI-powered conversational onboarding interface that captures business context and stores it as structured data and vector embeddings.
# Details:
Create ConversationalUI.tsx component for chat interface with message bubbles, input field, and real-time messaging. Build OnboardingForm.tsx with progress tracking and milestone indicators. Implement WebSocket connection for real-time chat using FastAPI WebSocket endpoint. Create AI service integration with OpenAI for conversational flow, intent recognition, and response generation. Build business context capture logic that extracts structured data (business name, type, target audience, goals) from conversational input. Implement Celery tasks for asynchronous embedding generation using OpenAI Ada v2 model. Store business context in businesses table and chunks/embeddings in respective tables. Create workspace chat persistence in workspace_chat_messages table. Implement context retrieval using vector similarity search.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for conversational UI components and AI service methods. Integration tests for WebSocket message flow and database operations. Test embedding generation and vector search functionality. E2E tests for complete onboarding flow from start to business profile completion.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Conversational UI Development [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the chat interface components for AI-powered onboarding conversations
### Details:
Create React components for chat bubbles, message input, typing indicators, and conversation flow. Implement message rendering with support for text, buttons, and interactive elements. Design responsive chat layout with proper scrolling and message history.

## 2. WebSocket Real-time Messaging Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement WebSocket connection for real-time bidirectional communication
### Details:
Set up WebSocket client connection, handle connection states, implement message sending/receiving, manage reconnection logic, and integrate with chat UI for real-time message delivery and typing indicators.

## 3. Frontend State Management for Onboarding [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement Redux/Context state management for onboarding flow and chat state
### Details:
Create state slices for chat messages, user responses, onboarding progress, AI conversation context, and user profile data. Implement actions and reducers for managing conversation flow and data persistence.

## 4. AI Service Integration with OpenAI [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Integrate OpenAI API for conversational AI and response generation
### Details:
Implement API calls to OpenAI for generating contextual responses, handle streaming responses, manage conversation context, implement error handling and fallback mechanisms, and optimize prompt engineering for onboarding scenarios.

## 5. Business Context Extraction and Structuring [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Extract and structure business information from user conversations
### Details:
Implement natural language processing to extract key business information (company size, industry, goals), structure extracted data into standardized formats, validate and normalize business context, and maintain conversation memory.

## 6. Vector Embedding Generation with Celery [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Implement asynchronous vector embedding generation for conversation context
### Details:
Set up Celery task queue for generating embeddings from conversation data, implement vector generation using OpenAI embeddings API, handle batch processing of conversation chunks, and manage embedding storage and retrieval.

## 7. Context Retrieval with Vector Similarity Search [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.6
### Description: Implement vector similarity search for contextual conversation retrieval
### Details:
Build vector similarity search functionality using cosine similarity, implement context retrieval based on current conversation, optimize search performance with indexing, and integrate retrieved context into AI responses.

## 8. Comprehensive Testing Strategy Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.7
### Description: Develop and execute unit, integration, and E2E testing for the onboarding system
### Details:
Create unit tests for React components and utility functions, implement integration tests for WebSocket communication and AI service integration, develop E2E tests for complete onboarding flows, and set up automated testing pipeline with coverage reporting.

## 9. Create User Profile Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement user profile management functionality including profile creation, updating, and retrieval as part of the workspace onboarding system.
### Details:
Migrate the user profile management functionality from the authentication system to the workspace onboarding flow. This will include implementing profile creation during onboarding, profile editing capabilities, and integration with the authentication system.
