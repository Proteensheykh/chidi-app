# Description: Create comprehensive product management system with support for variants, SKU generation, and inventory tracking.
# Details:
Build ProductForm.tsx with sections for basic product info, variant management, and inventory items. Create VariantManager.tsx for dynamic variant type and option management. Implement InventoryItemTable.tsx for SKU-specific pricing and stock management. Build ProductTable.tsx with filtering, sorting, and pagination. Create API endpoints: POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/products, /api/v1/products/{id}/inventory_items, /api/v1/inventory_items/{id}. Implement SKU auto-generation logic based on product name and variant combinations. Add SKU validation for format and uniqueness within business scope. Create transactional product creation/update logic handling products, variants, and inventory items atomically. Implement stock quantity tracking with non-negative constraints.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for SKU generation and validation logic. Integration tests for product CRUD operations and transactional integrity. Test variant combination generation and inventory item creation. E2E tests for complete product creation flow with multiple variants.
