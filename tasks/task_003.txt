# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create Database Schema and Models
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the complete database schema using Prisma for all core entities including businesses, products, conversations, and social connections.
# Details:
Create Prisma schema with all tables: users, businesses, products, product_variants, product_variant_options, inventory_items, social_connections, conversations, messages, ai_responses_log, business_context_chunks, workspace_chat_messages. Define proper relationships, foreign keys, indexes, and constraints. Create ENUM types for social_platform_type, message_sender_type, conversation_status, etc. Setup business_context_embeddings table in Supabase Vector with vector(1536) for OpenAI embeddings. Configure unique constraints (business_id + sku for inventory_items, etc.). Generate and run initial migration. Create Prisma client configuration and database session management.

# Test Strategy:
Validate schema generation and migration execution. Test foreign key constraints and cascading deletes. Verify unique constraints work correctly. Test database connection and basic CRUD operations for each model.
